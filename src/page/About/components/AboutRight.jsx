          Hello! I'm Jakaria Ahmod, a passionate, curious, and self-motivated
          web developer who is currently on the path to becoming a professional
          Software Engineer. I believe in the power of consistent learning,
          solving real-world problems through code, and building products that
          create real value for people. My journey in tech started with a simple
          curiosity: “How does a website work?” That single question led me into
          the world of web development, where I found my true passion. I started
          with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, I became
          confident in creating dynamic, responsive websites and went deeper
          into modern frontend technologies like React.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux,
          Ant Design, and Firebase. As a Frontend Developer, I love designing
          clean user interfaces and crafting smooth user experiences. But I
          didn't want to stop there. I wanted to build complete full-stack
          applications, and that’s when I decided to learn the MERN Stack —
          MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This gave me the ability
          to develop applications from end to end — from database to frontend —
          and take full ownership of projects. Currently, I’m working on
          improving my skills in backend development, database design, API
          integration, and user authentication. I’m also learning advanced
          topics such as data structures & algorithms, system design, and
          software architecture to become a well-rounded engineer who can build
          scalable and maintainable systems. Throughout my journey, I've
          completed several frontend projects, and now I’m shifting toward
          full-stack projects where I can apply both frontend and backend
          knowledge. My current focus is building real-world applications that
          solve specific problems, optimize performance, and deliver great user
          experiences. Apart from coding, I am also learning about version
          control with Git & GitHub, responsive design principles, and
          deployment using platforms like Vercel and Netlify.
